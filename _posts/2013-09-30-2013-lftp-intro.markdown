Problem: I have a seedbox and for FTP and SFTP connections get limited (probably my ISP?). 
They’ll start strong, but quickly get throttled down to 300 kbps. 
I know my home connection goes “up to” 2 mbps.


Solution A: 
Download a couple files at a time, with either Transmit or via a couple SCP processes in Screen. 
Not ideal as now you’re waiting just a long for a single file, but you’re multitasking.


Solution B:

1. split -b 500MB filename.mkv

2. scp them in Screen

3. cat xa* > filename.mkv

4. delete xa* locally and on the server.

Faster for a single file, but wholly tedious. Lots of parts to remember. 
Depending on your file (4GB+ HD files), splitting and catting can take a couple minutes on both ends.


Solution C: LFTP

1. lftp on Mini

2. open [server name]

3. [queue] pget filename.mkv

Automates the worst parts of Solution B. 
Uses segmented downloading, and out of the box it downloads the file in 5 parts, saturating my connection. 
Locally there’s no cruft to join or delete. Super fast.


Key LFTP Commands:

- pget [filename] – segmented download of a single file

- mirror [foldername] – download a directory

- queue [command] – add said command to the task queue. The queue starts immediately.

- queue – see current status of queued tasks

TODO:

- Screenshots of speeds, comparing the same file

- Detail bookmarking with LFTP

- Detail queueing in LFTP
