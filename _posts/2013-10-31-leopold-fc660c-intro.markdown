title: "Leopold FC660C Intro"
---

More and more co-workers of mine we getting mechanical keyboards, and I decided it was time to give &#8216;em a shot. 
I tried a Happy Hacking Pro 2, and liked the feel, and the reduced noise of the topre switched compared to the more standard MX switches. 
I ended up getting a [Leopold FC660C](http://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=leopold,compact&pid=fc660c).
It&#8217;s only been a day, but I&#8217;m loving it. My one reservation is the lack of out-of-the-box Media Key support, which I absolutely depend on. 
I was wary of the different key remapping apps out there, but [KeyRemap4MacBook](https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/) got a promising recommendation from a good friend. I got a little lost in all the configurable options, but eventually found what I needed:

Now a quick Fn + F## and you&#8217;re controlling your Mac like you were used to.
